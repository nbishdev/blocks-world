# Blocks World

This repository contains 2 Python source code files with a simple implementation of a solution to the [Blocks world problem](https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/california-housing-prices).<br/>


This software supports up to 26 blocks (as many as the number of letters in the English alphabet).


In order to execute the code, you will also need the following 2 Python source files from the [AIMA Python source code repository](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python):
* search.py
* utils.py


To execute the code, place all the 4 required source files in the same directory, cd in that directory and type:
```bash
python ./Main.py -n <number-of-blocks>
```

The code is written in Python 3.
